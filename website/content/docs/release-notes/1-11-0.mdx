# Consul 1.11.0

## Release Highlights

- **Admin Partitions (Enterprise):** Consul 1.11.0 Enteprise introduces a new entity for defining administrative and networking boundaries within a Consul deployment. For more information refer to the [Admin Partitions](/docs/enterprise/admin-partitions) documentation.

- **Support for xDS v3 and Incremental xDS:** Consul 1.10 will default to using xDS version 3 and Incremental xDS for all supported Envoy proxy versions bootstrapped by the Consul 1.10 CLI. This is driven by the fact that xDS v2 was deprecated in Envoy 1.15 and disabled in Envoy 1.17. Envoy proxies bootstrapped with older Consul CLI binaries will continue to use the xDS v2 state-of-the-world API.

- **Streaming Enabled by Default for Service Health:** Streaming is a major architectural enhancement in how update notifications for blocking queries are delivered within the cluster which significantly reduces CPU and network bandwidth usage for large-scale Consul deployments. In Consul 1.10, streaming is now available for the service health HTTP endpoint and is enabled by default.

- **Redesigned UI and Observability Enhancements:** The Consul UI has been redesigned with a new sidebar layout. Additionally, Kubernetes users now have the ability to deploy Prometheus via the Consul Helm chart which automatically integrates it with Consulâ€™s Service Visualization UI for displaying traffic metrics between services. Lastly, Pod and Envoy metrics can now be exposed to Prometheus using Kubernetes annotations via a single aggregated endpoint.

## What's Changed
 
- The legacy ACL system that was deprecated in Consul 1.4.0 has been removed. Before upgrading you should verify that nothing is still using the legacy ACL system. See the [Migrate Legacy ACL Tokens Learn Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-token-migration) for more information. 
- Drops support for Envoy versions 1.15.x and 1.16.x
